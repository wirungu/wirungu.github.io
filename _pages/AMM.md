I've recently started submitting to the *Problems* section of the [American Mathematical Monthly](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/american-mathematical-monthly) and
I will begin occasionally posting extended versions of my solutions here after the submission deadline.
I'd enjoy hearing from anyone who wants to share solutions by email.

- [Problem 12378:](/assets/pdf/amm_problem_12372-20230603211538.pdf)
        For $$\alpha >0 $$ evaluate $$\int_0^1 \frac{\ln |x^\alpha - (1-x)^{\alpha}|}{x} d x.$$
